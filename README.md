This repo is a backup for my lots of rcs on my linux, I hope this can make me easier if I change my computer.

I keep this repo public because maybe someone needs them for reference.

In case you get here not by a search engine, I wrote this README to help you understand the structure of this repo, which is very very simple, all you need is to check the file `AutoBackup.sh`, that's how this repo runs.

I write lots of comments in the code, some in English and some in Chinese, you can use a Google Translater, maybe, I guess.
